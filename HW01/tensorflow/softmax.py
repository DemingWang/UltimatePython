"""Builds the MNIST softmax network.

Implements the inference/loss/training pattern for model building.

1. inference() - Builds the model as far as is required for running the network
forward to make predictions.
2. loss() - Adds to the inference model the layers required to generate loss.
3. training() - Adds to the loss model the Ops required to generate and
apply gradients.
