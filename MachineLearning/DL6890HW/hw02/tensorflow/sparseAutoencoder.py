"""Builds the sAE network and operations to compute the cost.

Implements the loss/training pattern for feature learning.

1. los() - Builds the model as far as is required for running the network
forward to make predictions. Adds to the inference model the layers required
to generate loss.
3. training() - Adds to the loss model the Ops required to generate and
apply gradients.
